help_message="${usage_message}

Manages HDFS user directories.

This will ensure that users in the specified list of groups
all have HDFS user (home) directories at hdfs:///user/<username>.
This script must be run by the HDFS super user 'hdfs'.

Options:
  -c, --check-for-changes  Checks if there are any HDFS user directories
                           that need created for users in <group>.
                           If there are, this will exit 3.
  -n, --dry-run            Don't actually create directories, just
                           output what would have been done.  Note that
                           this option does nothing when combined with -c.
  -v, --verbose            Run in verbose mode.
